# Quick Start: Record Your First Session

Follow these steps to record and replay your analytics workflow.

## Prerequisites

Make sure Playwright is installed:
```bash
playwright --version
```

If not installed:
```bash
pip3 install playwright
playwright install chromium
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start Recording (2 minutes)

```bash
python3 record_session.py
```

**Two windows will open:**
- **Browser window** (left) - Interact here
- **Inspector window** (right) - Shows generated code

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Perform Your Workflow (5 minutes)

In the **browser window**, do your normal routine:

1. ‚úÖ Enter email and password
2. ‚úÖ Click "Log In"
3. ‚úÖ Navigate to Analytics page (or it might auto-navigate)
4. ‚úÖ Click "Saudi Arabia" button
5. ‚úÖ Click "Filter" button
6. ‚úÖ Click on the date range input
7. ‚úÖ Select your start date
8. ‚úÖ Select your end date
9. ‚úÖ Click "Apply" (in date picker)
10. ‚úÖ Click "Apply" (in filter dialog if there's a second one)
11. ‚úÖ Wait for data to load

**Watch the Inspector window** - Python code appears as you interact!

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Copy the Generated Code (1 minute)

In the **Inspector window**:
1. Click the "Copy" button (top right)
2. OR select all the code (Cmd+A) and copy (Cmd+C)

**Close both windows when done.**

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Save the Code (2 minutes)

1. Open `automation/analytics_recorded.py` in your editor
2. Find the `replay_actions()` function
3. Look for this comment:
   ```python
   # TODO: PASTE YOUR RECORDED ACTIONS HERE
   ```
4. **Replace the TODO section** with your copied code
5. Save the file

**Example of what to paste:**
```python
def replay_actions(page: Page):
    page.goto("https://app.codpartner.com/login")
    page.fill('input[name="email"]', "your@email.com")
    page.fill('input[name="password"]', "your_password")
    page.click('button:has-text("Log In")')
    page.click('text="Saudi arabia"')
    # ... rest of your actions
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Replay (1 minute)

```bash
python3 replay_recorded_session.py
```

**What you'll see:**
- Browser opens
- Your actions replay automatically
- A trace file is saved: `traces/analytics_session.zip`

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ View the Visual Playbook (2 minutes)

```bash
python3 view_trace.py
```

**Explore the trace viewer:**
- üì∏ Screenshots of every action
- üîç Inspect elements at each step
- üìä See network requests
- ‚úÖ Verify which selectors worked

## üéâ Success!

You now have:
- ‚úÖ Working recorded code
- ‚úÖ Visual trace with screenshots
- ‚úÖ Reference for debugging
- ‚úÖ Exact selectors that work

## üîß Next Steps

### Extract Working Selectors

Open the trace viewer and look for:
- Date picker selectors
- Button selectors
- Filter dialog selectors

Copy these to update `automation/codpartner.py` if needed.

### Remove Hardcoded Credentials

In `automation/analytics_recorded.py`, replace:
```python
page.fill('input[name="email"]', "your@email.com")
page.fill('input[name="password"]', "your_password")
```

With:
```python
from .config import Config
config = Config()
page.fill('input[name="email"]', config.USERNAME)
page.fill('input[name="password"]', config.PASSWORD)
```

### Record Different Workflows

Run `record_session.py` again to record:
- Different date ranges
- Different countries
- Different pages (Orders, Inventory, etc.)

Save each as a different file:
- `automation/analytics_recorded.py`
- `automation/orders_recorded.py`
- `automation/inventory_recorded.py`

## üí° Tips

1. **Go slow** during recording - give pages time to load
2. **Add waits** in code if replay is too fast:
   ```python
   page.wait_for_timeout(2000)  # Wait 2 seconds
   ```
3. **Record in chunks** - don't try to record everything at once
4. **Keep traces** - they're great debugging references

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**Problem: Inspector shows no code**
- Solution: Make sure you're clicking in the browser window, not the Inspector

**Problem: Replay fails at login**
- Solution: Check `.env` file has correct credentials

**Problem: Trace file not found**
- Solution: Run `replay_recorded_session.py` first to create the trace

**Problem: Can't view trace**
- Solution: Run `playwright install` to install browsers
